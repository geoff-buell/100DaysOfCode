# The 100 Days of Code Challenge
### Status: Completed

Welcome to my projects that I developed during the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. If you would like to know more about the challenge, you can read about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

The challenge ended up being a very creative, productive, and rewarding time for me. I was able to complete 50 mini projects by coding at least 1 hour a day, although the majority of those days were 4-6 hours per day. I was also able to get more familiar with React and D3.js, and I was able to begin learning some backend technologies as well.

See the [full list](https://www.geoffreybuell.com/coding-challenge.html) of how I spent my 100 days.

I also kept a Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/geoffrey_buell/status/1369076333133766657) of my progress.
