# The 100 Days of Code Challenge
### Status: Completed

Welcome to my projects that I developed during the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. If you would like to know more about the challenge, you can read about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

The challenge ended up being a very creative, productive, and rewarding time for me. I was able to complete 50 mini projects by coding at least 1 hour a day, although the majority of those days were 4-6 hours per day. I was also able to get more familiar with React and D3.js, and I was able to begin learning some backend technologies as well.

See the [full list](https://www.geoffreybuell.com/coding-challenge.html) of how I spent my 100 days.

I also kept a Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/geoffrey_buell/status/1369076333133766657) of my progress.

### Favorite 5 Projects:

- [Simon Game](https://codepen.io/geoffbuell/full/bGgojOa)
    - HTML, SCSS and JS.
    - Designed to mimic the classic game as closely as possible.
    - Hardest Challenge: Learning and applying AudioContext and Oscillator Nodes.

- [Ruby Heist Game](https://codepen.io/geoffbuell/full/RwKwVEx) *(featured on Codepen.io)*
    - HTML, CSS and JS.
    - Simple concept, steal the ruby without running into any security lasers.
    - Hardest Challenge: Figuring out the position of ruby (draggable element) and checking to see if any part of its surface area is overlapping one of the security lasers, which are being fired on and off randomly.

- [Virtual Keyboard](https://codepen.io/geoffbuell/full/abJXVWr)
    - HTML, CSS and JS.
    - A great project idea for anyone trying to learn JS.
    - Hardest Challenge: Writing function to delete selected text.

- [Dad Jokes Generator](https://codepen.io/geoffbuell/full/vYxvBQL)
    - HTML, CSS and JS.
    - Produces random jokes from the icanhazdadjoke.com API.
    - Hardest Challenge: Surprisingly, realizing I needed to include an Accept header to get the JSON response that I wanted (always read the documentation).

- [Portrait of a Young Robot](https://codepen.io/geoffbuell/full/poeJKMj)
    - HTML and SCSS.
    - I just like to draw robots. They’re fun.
    - Hardest Challenge: The same thing that has always plagued me from my illustration background – spending too much time going back and forth on color options, shadows, highlights and opacities.

Thanks for reading!
